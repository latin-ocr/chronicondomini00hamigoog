PREFACE.

In the Preface to the former volume ol this

Chronicle some observatione were offered on its
historical velue, and the life os its author; but,
an opinion that the portion subsequent to the
- year 1297 was written by a continuator at a
later period was not adverted to.² The abrupt
termination of three of the MSS. at that year,
and-the intention expressed in the prologue of
bringing the History down to the year 1300,
appear to have been the principal causes which
led to this supposition3 but there is reason sor
belicving that the whole of the reign of Ed-
ward Ι.’, if not of Edward II. and 111„ came
from the pen of Hemingburgh. The MSS.

at the Collega of Arme,2 MS. Cotton. Tiberius
B. 1v.‚ and the MS. R. 7, 9, in Trinity Collega,
Cambridge. These MSS. are well written on
