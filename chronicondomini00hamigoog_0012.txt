notos 0 very early date. On the other hand,
MS. Lansdown, which is of higher antiquity,
apparently contemporary, concludes with the .

death 01 Edward 1., and attributes the whole ·

to Hemingburgh. MSS. C. G. C. Cant. 250, and
Stowe, 11. xlviii, the latter written in 1133,
have the Chronicle complete to the accession 01
Edward ΙΙΙ., and MS. Coll. Trio. R. 5, 10,
110 01010 History, from the conquest to the
Battle 01 Cressy. Internal evidence goes sar to
strengthen the above view. Under the year
1297, before the conclusion 01 any 01 110 Manu·
scripts, the following expression occurs, “ by
the mediation 01 110 venerable father, 11011001-
1101οο 01 0001011000, 1101οη de Wynchelse,
whose memory is blessed,'’¹ which shows that
Hemingburgh was living after the death 01
Robert Winohelsey‚ llth May, 1313, and that
the reign 01 Edward I. was compiled at some
period subsequent to the accession 01 Edward
II. And in 1299 we have a direct reference
to Gisburn in the following passaget—“The
same year, on the 1711 01 February, died Lord
John de Bulmer‚ a gallant knight, and most
estimahle neighbour, and was buried at Gisburn,
before the altar 01 St. John the Baptistss’t
